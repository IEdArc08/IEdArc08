## Welcome to my profile!
Hello, and welcome, this is Ian!

I am currently a CS Sophomore studying at UIC, aiming to graduate in 2027. I'm aiming to get certifications and more for a job in cybersecurity, but I also like to dabble in things such as web design, and more. Lately I have also been attending competitions such as Sparkhacks 2025 here in UIC!

When not coding, I enjoy to play Magic the Gathering and working with content creators in that field, as well as video games such as Baldurs Gate 3 and Dead by Daylight. 

I tend to connect with many people, so no matter what I want to do, I can always manage to get things done in the nick of time! At school, I manage the Social Gaming Club as the secretary of Trading Card Games and work at the nearby parking lot.

While due to schoolwork, I donâ€™t always have time for personal projects. However, when I do, I will post them here for others to see!
